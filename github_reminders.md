#Git reminders

#Commit often
This saves changes to git locally on your computer, but does not update the github repository

#Push less often (maybe once daily), when things are more polished
This pushes changes to the online github reposiory

#always pull before pushing new commits
This will ensure that there are not conflicts if another is working on code at same time.
