# Based on maturity plots, somewhere around 300-350mm would be reasonable
# to set as size break based on size at reproductive maturity. As expected,
# males mature at smaller sizes (300mm, vs. 325-350 for females)

# length freq histograms are messier, size distribution changes a lot each year.
# But, the ~325mm from maturity plots seems reasonable based on length freq
# histograms too. The only other natural break I see is around 125mm for the
# smallest size class, but these fish don't have PIT tags so we can't analyze
# a <125mm size class anyway
